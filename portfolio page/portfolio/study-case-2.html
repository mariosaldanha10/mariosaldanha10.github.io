    <h1>Case Study: Clouds-Are-Us Cloud Engineering Project</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>You have been hired as a cloud engineer for a new cloud computing start-up company called Clouds-Are-Us. Clouds-Are-Us has hired you to assist with setting up some of the networking infrastructure. You will report into the Clouds-Are-Us cloud engineering manager. The Clouds-Are-Us company has just launched some new products, and they are ready to share some information with prospective customers. They have 3 requirements that they wish you to complete. “Clouds-Are-Us will be launching a suite of services, in a couple of months. The company will specialise in the development of digital technology solutions, software design and agile software development and cloud computing consulting services.” <- Ensure to advertise this on their marketing page below in task 1.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Clouds-Are-Us would like to setup a static website where customers can learn about their services. To host a static website, they have requested me to configure an Amazon S3 bucket and utilize simple static website hosting. They then wish me to upload some sample content to let customers know that their many services will be available soon (see information in introduction above). All of the website content should be uploaded to one bucket. They require secure, durable, highly scalable object storage. They need a simple web services interface to allow them to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.</p>

    <p>Screenshot of my final static website (including short description of the Clouds-Are-Us services.)</p>

    <h3>Data on S3 and EC" with EBS.</h3>
    <p>The company would like you to explain to them the key differences between storing data on S3 compared to storing data on EC2 with EBS. They wish to know use cases for each, find out what’s similar, what’s different and to provide a de-tailed analysis of each.</p>

    <h3>The Key differences between storing data on S3 compared to store data on EC2 with EBS</h3>
    <p>In terms of storage when using S3 to store data in a company for example this resource is designed to store large amount of data and backup. On the other hand, the resources of storing data on EBS can be comparable to hard disks using in computers but virtualized. They differ in performance because ESB can have a better performance of S3. They both also have a high durability across different Availability Zones. The uses cases of Amazon S3 is that this resource can be used in Data Lake and big Data Analytics as well as Backup and restoration. On the other hand, EBS use cases are for Software Testing and Development, Business continuity and Enterprise-wide applications.</p>

    <p>In the medium term, the management at Clouds-Are-Us wishes to setup infrastructure utilizing high availability using the following illustration as a guide (as shown in Figure 1 below):</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/screenshots/clouds-are-us infra.png" alt="Infra Photo">
    <p>website on group of load balanced web servers</p>

    <p>Demonstrate and create five Linux servers that use the start-up script provided (see below). The start-up script will install Linux updates, install the HTTP web service, and load a test that shows the name of the Web Server. Using these 5 Linux instances, set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that includes these web servers that need to add to a target group.</p>

    <p></p>
  
    <p>Clouds-Are-Us has contracted with the DigiTech corporation to host their website. The management at DigiTech wishes to automate the infrastructure deployment of their website and they would like to see a proof of concept. Your manager at Clouds-Are-Us would like you to set up an Auto-Scaling Group (ASG) integrated with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) on one of the subnets in a VPC that you will create (or a VPC that you will soon create). In addition to demonstrating this configuration, explain, using a real-world example, the benefits integrating the ASG combined with the ALB.</p>


    <p>Explain how the proposed DigiTech ALB works and what benefits it provides to DigiTech. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a ‘Well Architecture Framework’ that includes several ‘Pillars of Architectural Excellence’ that provide a framework of cloud computing best practices. In your explanation, discuss two of the architectural design principals that would be utilized while planning the cloud architecture that would be provided by combining the ASG with the ALB.</p>

    <p>Join me as we delve into the details of these tasks, exploring the intricacies of cloud computing, networking, and the strategic decisions that shaped the success of Clouds-Are-Us' foray into the digital frontier. This case study serves as a testament to my proficiency in cloud technologies, problem-solving acumen, and commitment to implementing industry best practices.</p>
